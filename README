Description:
This is a bash script I wrote to backup files and folders from remote Raspberry Pi devices I service for customers.
It used Rsync through SSH (Port 22) to get the files onto the local machine.

The remotehost must have your SSH Authorized Key for connection or you will be prompted with password for every rsync command. 
eg. cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@host 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
or
eg. http://www.howtogeek.com/66776/how-to-remotely-copy-files-over-ssh-without-entering-your-password/

It compresses and uploads the file to Dropbox. Please read how to set up the dropbox_uploader.sh script from the link above.

Then emails a copy of the log and ends.

Usage:
remotebackup.sh [user@one.remote.host.com] - backups one server with the remotebackup_servers.cfg files list

remotebackup.sh - backs up ALL servers and files found in the remotebackup_servers.cfg

Please check the cfg files for your setup.
